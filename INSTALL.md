# Building CLFS

Steps to build CLFS:
1.  Start with the `menuconfig` command to create a configuration file
    `config.inc`, for the build system.
2.  Next, run the `setup` command to format and mount the partitions to be
    used.
3.  To start the build, run the `build` command.

The result will be a shiny new CLFS system!
